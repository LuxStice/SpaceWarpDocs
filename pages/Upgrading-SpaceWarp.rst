Upgrading to the Latest Version of Space Warp
==============================================

Non-BepInEx Users
-----------------

If you are using a version of Space Warp that is not BepInEx 
(either because it is too early and does not support BepInEx 
or because you did not choose it), you need to use either the 
`Installer <https://github.com/SpaceWarpDev/Space-Warp-Installer/releases/tag/Latest>`_
and uninstall that way, or you need to delete the game folder and reinstall the game
(recommended).

Previous BepInEx Users
----------------------

If you chose a BepInEx version of Space Warp but it is an older
version, you should first try to simply download the new version
and attempt to install it on top of the existing game directory,
and click "replace all changed files". If that doesn't work, you
can attempt to delete the "BepInEx" folder and download the new
version to install it.

Global Solution
---------------

If you encounter any issues during the upgrade process, the recommended
solution is to delete the game directory and reinstall the game. Clicking
uninstall has proven sketchy for people, so it is highly recommended to
delete the game folder. Verifying the integrity of the installation WILL
NOT DELETE Space Warp. Space Warp has been successfully used by over 10,000
people, and it will probably work for you too if you try hard enough.
